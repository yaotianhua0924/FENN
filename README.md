The directory code is the original content of parameter optimization, single model, combined model respectively, and does not contain data, where the specific points are shown below.
ARIMA, LM, SCG，LSTM and BR are respectively models established by using the monthly incidence data of hepatitis C in China, among which MAT file is the result of code and data preservation after the operation.
Sarima_LSTM, Sarima_LM, Sarima_BR and Sarima_SCG are the combined models established by using the monthly incidence data of hepatitis C in China, among which MAT file is the saving file of running results.
Brucellosis, Hepatitis B, Tubercylosis were the codes and results of running on the combined model for the monthly incidence data of such diseases in the country.
Objective b -Region, objective C-Region and Varicella-Region were the results of combination model operation on the monthly incidence data of these diseases in Chongqing.
CHIO.m、ClusteringCost.m、ICHIO.m、SSA.m、SinusoidalMap.m、initialization.m、initializationNew.m、main.m are the source code of metaheuristic algorithm optimization process.
XLSX is the incidence raw data file.
